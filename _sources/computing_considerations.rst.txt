Computing Considerations
************************

This page aims to describe the megalodon processing workflow, highlighting relevant computing considerations.

------------------
Raw Signal Loading
------------------

Raw signal is loaded from either single- or multi-FAST5 format via the ``ont_fast5_api``.
Raw signal is loaded within worker processes when a read_id/file is pulled off of the reads queue.

The reads queue is filled from a separate worker process.
This process will enumerate FAST5 files and all read_ids stored within these files, but per-read processing will begin as soon as the first read_id/file is found.
Users may notice a period of time where the progress bar does not have a known total number of reads.
Once read enumeration is complete the progress bar will update to include the known total and ETA for run completion.

------------
Base Calling
------------

Base calling consists of running the neural network and then decoding this output.
The neural network is currently run using the taiyaki backend.
This backend allows either CPU or GPU computing.
When GPUs are provided (via the ``--devices`` argument) only the neural network processing is completed on the GPU.
All other steps (including forward-backward algorithm and viterbi decoding) are computed on the CPU only.

-----------------
Reference Mapping
-----------------

Read mapping is completed using the ``minimap2`` python interface (``mappy``).
The reference index is loaded into shared memory.
A separate thread is linked to each per-read processing worker in order to access the shared memory index.
Thus users may notice threads opened for this processing.
These threads will generally consume very little compute.

-----------------------------
SNP and Modified Base Calling
-----------------------------

SNP and modified base calling is computed within the per-read processing workers using CPU resources.
Generally, this portion of processing will comsume a minority of the compute resources.
Proposing many SNPs (e.g. all possible 3+ base indels) may show a bottle neck at this portion of processing.
Internal testing shows that proposal of all possible single base substitutions shows minimal processing at this portion of per-read processing.
Note that the data bases storing per-read SNP variants may show slower indexing with very large proposed SNP sets (performed at the end of per-read processing).
