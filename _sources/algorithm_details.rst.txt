Megalodon Algorithm Details
***************************

This page describes the details of how megalodon processes the raw nanopore signal to produce highly-accurate modified base and SNP calls.

------------
Base Calling
------------

Basecalling is performed as in taiyaki and guppy.
Raw nanopore signal is normalizied (using median and MAD scaling), chunked, processed with a recurrent neural network and decoded using the forward-backward algorithm.
These steps are described in the taiyaki documentation.

-------------------
Reference Anchoring
-------------------

Megalodon's functionality centers on the anchoring of the high-information neural network basecalling output to a reference sequence.
Given anchored neural network output, alternatives to the reference (either modified bases or canonical bases) are proposed and scored to produce the highest accuracy results.

The neural network output is anchored to the reference via standard read mapping of produced basecalls to the reference sequence (maintaining the link to the neural network outputs).
If no reference mapping is produced (using ``minimap2`` via the ``mappy`` python interface) that read is not processed further (basecalls will be output if requested).
This standard read mapping is processed to produce a matching of each basecall with a reference position.
Reference positions within an insertion or deletion are assigned to the previous mapped read position (left justified).
This constitutes the reference anchoring used for modified base and SNP calling steps.

-----------
SNP Calling
-----------

Megalodon currently filters alleles over a certain maximum size (default 50) as performance on larger indels has not currenty been validated.

At each valid variant a region of context sequence around the variant is extracted.
The context sequence allows the scoring algorithm to traverse slightly different paths through the local neural network output.
The width of this sequence of interest is defined by the ``--variant-context-bases`` argument (specified individually for single base SNVs and indels; defaults 10 and 30 respectively).

Next the neural network output corresponding to the reference sequence of interest is extracted.
The fuzzy reference anchoring described above identifies the range of the neural network output containing the sequence of interest.

The sequence scoring function performs the forward-backward algorithm and Viterbi algorithm over the neural network output to produce a score for the reference and proposed alternative sequence.
The difference between these two scores is the assigned score for the proposed variant.
Lower (negative) score are evidence for the alternative sequence and higher (positive) scores are evidence for the reference sequence.

These raw scores are softmax values over potential states, to match characteristics of a probability distribution.
In practice, these scores do not match emperical probabilities for a SNP given a truth dataset.
Thus a calibration step is applied to convert these scores to estimated emperical probabilities.
This enables more accurate aggregation across reads.

Finally, calls across reads at each reference location are aggregated in order make a sample-level call.
These results will be output into a VCF format file.

Currently ``diploid`` (default) and ``haploid`` SNP aggregation modes are available.
In ``haploid`` mode the probability of the reference and alternative alleles are simply the normalized (via Bayes' theorem) product of the individual read probabilities.
In ``diploid`` mode the probability of each genotype (homozygous reference, heterozygous and homozygous alternative) are computed.
The probabilities for homozygous alleles are as in the ``haploid`` mode, while the heterozygous probability is given by the weighted sum of the maximal probabilities taken over the sampling distribution (binomial with ``p=0.5``) given a true diploid heterozygous allele.
These probabilities are then normalized given by Bayes' theorem.

---------------------
Modified Base Calling
---------------------

Modified base calling is performed largely in the same manner as variant calling above in terms of sequence and associated nueral network output extraction.
The main difference is that instead of proposing alternative bases in the sequence, a modification is proposed.
This means that in order to identify a particular modification the model must be aware of this modification.
Training models for particular modifications of interest is described in the taiyaki software documentation.

Use the ``--mod-motif`` argument in order to restrict tested locations to certain relevant motifs (e.g. ``--mod-motif Z CG 0`` to test only in CpG locations).
